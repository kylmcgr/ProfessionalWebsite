  Hi! I'm <strong>Kyle McGraw</strong>. I'm a data scientist and AI engineer based in New York, NY.<br><br>
  I am a quick learner that is always looking to pick up new skills and use these skills to solve complex problems. I am passionate about using computational techniques to solve real-world problems and have a particular interest in brain-computer interfaces (BCI).<br><br>
  I was most recently a BCI data scientist / machine learning engineer at<a href="https://ae.studio">AE Studio</a>.

  Some of my other previous work includes <a href="https://github.com/kylmcgr/Surgical-Risk-Calculator-SURF">developing machine learning models for surgical risk prediction</a> (two papers in the works!), working with <a href="https://sumnernorman.com">Sumner Norman</a> (currently doing very cool work at <a href="https://forestneurotech.org">Forest Neurotech</a>) in the Andersen to develop a functional ultrasound
